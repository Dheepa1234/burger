Node Express Handlebars Homework

This application is a burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern. The application uses Node and MySQL to query and route data. Handlebars generates the HTML.

How this application works

1)	The application should let users input the names of burgers they’d like to eat.
2)	When a user submits a burger’s name, the application will display the burger on the left side of the page.
3)	Each burger in the waiting area has a Devour It! Button attached to it.
4)	When the user clicks the Devour It! Button, the burger moves to the right side of the page.
The app stores every burger in a database, regardless of whether it is devoured or not
